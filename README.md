# DHL_report_tool
This code automates and formats a bi-weekly report

The tool pulls the data from daily data files retrived from internal company website, reformats the files for data extraction, and formats 
the required data into a new workbook ready for use.

The excel file also contains 3 buttons assigned to file_location(), extra_file(), and Begin().

This only partially automates the entire report process, however further steps requires both manual evaluation, and procedures outside of
my capabilities currently.
